**Sometimes you have to get really out of alignment to recognize what being in alignment looks and feels like.**

_You can’t be brave without feeling fear._

_It’s hard to be courageous when you’re not facing down danger or potential pain._

_You have to experience sadness to recognize and appreciate joy._

In the same vein, it’s hard to know what feels right, good, and true for you without experiencing what feels all wrong.

This can apply to the foods you eat (or don’t eat), your relationships or community, your business or career. Where you live. All of it.

We’re in the thick of a season of realigning ourselves with what’s good and true for us – individually and as a family. We’re sorting out eight years of a branch of our business that, in some ways, has felt out of alignment for a long time. We’re talking through the mistakes and lessons learned and feeling hopeful about the future.

But, make no mistake about: aligning with your core values, strengths, and passions is no easy feat. It’s messy. It requires too many hard conversations and coming face-to-face with ugly truths about people, yourself, and, really, the world at large.

A woman once told me that people will have a hard time understanding my work because I’m teaching “spiritual nutrition.” I didn’t know what to make of her feedback. There’s no talk of any religion or faith in my sessions (unless a client brings it to the table).

A few years later, and more feedback in a similar light, I’m starting to come to terms with the fact that maybe what she meant was that the benefits of our sessions go beyond the surface-level features of good nutrition, and starts to open up a conversation about what both your body and your soul need to feel nourished.

As I’ve spent the last year grappling with all of the challenges of the last decade, as well as the changes we’re making, **I’ve felt incredibly – sometimes alarmingly – unwell.**

-   Digestive issues
-   Compromised immunity
-   Too many sleepless nights
-   Skin problems
-   A mind and body that can’t slow down
-   Anxiety

Signs and symptoms of physiological imbalance in my body — and no smoothie or supplement, superfood or sweat session has brought any sort of lasting relief for me.

Considering the fact that we’ve all collectively been navigating the uncertainties, challenges, and changes brought on by a pandemic, **I know I’m not alone in feeling out of sorts, physically, mentally, and emotionally.**

I’ve said it once and I keep finding opportunities to say it again apparently: You can eat the best, most nutritious foods available to you. You can exercise consistently, drink plenty of water, and do any of the other “health hacks” so prevalent in today’s world. **But, sometimes, you have to go deeper.**

I’m often categorized as a deep thinker. Never one to miss the opportunity to dig for deeper meaning behind life’s seemingly mundane moments. (Or symptoms.) A gift at best. Other times it just makes me really tired. A few years ago, when my husband and I were in the thick of unknowns around whether or not we’d be able to have children, a man came into our lives that frequently asked people: _How are things with your soul?_ (Of course, I relished this question.)

I know. I can _feel_ some of you rolling your eyes. I’m squirming in my seat just thinking about sharing this story with you. But, as I look around and think about it: **Maybe it’s a question we’re not getting asked enough in today’s world?** Especially not in relation to our health.

If your experience is anything like mine, **there isn’t a health hack in existence that can make up for prolonged periods of feeling like things just aren’t where you’d like them to be, no matter how hard you try.**

I don’t think it’s an easy question to answer: _How are things going with your soul?_ It requires quiet and time and self awareness and maybe even a trained professional. Most of us have a hard time “finding” quiet and time. Maybe you think it’s weird or irrelevant or even a question of privilege in light of the greater demands of the day.

I’ll circle back to my belief that it’s a question that’s not getting asked enough in today’s world and one that is of great benefit to the recipient.

So, I guess I’ll leave you with the question: _How are things with your soul?_

I hope you spend some time answering that question. Roll your eyes at me while you’re doing it, if it makes you feel better.

Sincerely,

Lindsey
