I’m thinking of you today as many of you may be settling into your kitchen to prepare for a few days of feasting. 

It may surprise you to learn that it was only recently that I settled into a calm (and calming) relationship with my kitchen. Surprising because I threw myself into the world of food and cooking and health ten years ago…I’ve been doing this for a decade! Not to mention, I’m married to a chef and we own a small food spot.

But, it’s true. Being in the kitchen had me feeling frazzled up until last year. Not just being in the kitchen, but even the pre-steps that meant I was moving in its direction — things like meal planning and organization stressed me out, too. 

So if you’re feeling frazzled right now, too…I understand.

That’s why I wanted to pop in and share a few simple ways to bring more calm to your kitchen, even amongst the mixing bowls and measuring spoons or little people and sweet pups under foot.

Since I know you probably have lots of timers going today, I’ll keep this short and sweet. **Here’s how I’ve shaped my kitchen into one of my favorite places to be:**

## Music
I’ve kept a small speaker in our kitchen for years now, and after pouring a cup of coffee and some early-morning moments of quiet, music is the next thing to turn on in our house. The energy of the music sets the tone for our day and carries us through until the end — so choose whatever music helps you feel calm and glad to be in your kitchen. If you need some inspiration, here are a few playlists we’re liking right now:

## Start with a soothing scent
Lately I’ve been burning scents of apple cider, vanilla and palo santo. Something about these scents settles and stills my whole system. If there are any smells that bring up good memories of traditions passed, bring those into your kitchen. Of course, you’ll experience a kaleidoscopic of aromas once your cooking begins!

## Make a plan for tidying up
Jamie and I have a strong kitchen clean-up routine — basically, I cook and get food on the table, and he gets the kitchen back to a clean slate at the end of each night. The dishes get put in the dishwasher, the dishwasher gets started, the counters are wiped and cleared. Every night, we put our kitchen to bed, so to speak. It’s a habit that serves us well and makes creating meals for my family much easier and more enjoyable. The next morning, dishes get unloaded and put away while breakfast cooks — and onward we go. 

## Think about creating memories that are as sweet as your pie

Something I’ve been thinking about is the fact that I’m currently the conductor of my daughter’s daily reality and the memories she’ll hold of them. This fact encourages me to try — oh, but I try — to embrace the mess and flurry of activity in the kitchen so that when she looks back on her Thanksgiving traditions under our roof, she’ll remember security, peacefulness, and warmth. 

## Honor your health

If you’re regularly feeling stressed in your kitchen, I’d like to encourage you to get curious about what your body is asking of you. Do you need to scale back on the number of dishes you bring to the table? Do you need to enlist the help of a family member for cleaning up between recipes? Do you need to order out? Whatever helps you breathe deeper…try to lean into that. In doing so, know that you’re supporting your own body’s needs in this generally chaotic season. 

If you celebrate Thanksgiving, I hope your plate is also full of security, peacefulness, and warmth. I hope there are plenty of helpings of tender memories of those whose bodies are no longer at the table, but, in the words of one of my mentors, “whose presence is collectively held.” 

Happy thanksgiving to you and yours.
