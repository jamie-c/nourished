Some of the best memories of my childhood revolve around long summer evenings, my dad’s Black Weber grill, hamburgers, and family. It wasn’t a proper summer without dad’s perfect burgers.

So when I set out to reduce meat in my diet over a decade ago, hamburgers were one of the hardest items to replace.

Growing up, Jamie’s family loved to frequent a place called Super Onion Burger — although, back then, he didn’t care much for onions and ordered his onion burger _without_ them. (Ha!) Now, he’s shaking his head thinking about ordering an onion burger without onions!

When it comes to meatless burger options, there are a lot of fun bean burger recipes to try out. But, personally speaking, a bean burger doesn’t always hit the spot for a true hamburger craving. We eat a bean burger to eat a bean burger. When we get a craving for a hamburger, but aren’t in the mood for meat, we sink our teeth into these delicious onion Beyond Burgers. They’re juicy, full of flavor, and can come to the table in only 30 minutes!

## Before we get to the recipe, here are a few FAQs about these burgers.

### Are Plant-Based Meat Alternatives Healthy?

To be clear, by meat alternatives, we’re not talking about your standard veggie burger made with whole plant ingredients like grains, nuts, or beans. We’re talking about meat substitutes that mimic real beef in texture, appearance, and, in some cases, taste.

Some of the perks of these products include the reduction of red meat from the diet, and reduced potential of exposure to added hormones or antibiotics. But, on the flip side, meatless burgers are industrially processed, manufactured food items. You’ll generally find more salt (a higher sodium content) in these products, as well as the same amount of saturated fat as traditional burgers.

We’re never about letting perfectionism run the roost, and consider meat alternatives to be a fun and enjoyable choice for those times when you just want a burger!

### Do you need to take the internal temperature for these burgers?

Even though you’re working with a meatless patty, we still recommend cooking them until they’ve reached an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit. Using a thermometer will ensure the best results, preserving the juices and flavor, and reduce the risk of overcooking the burgers.

You’ll know the burgers are done when the onions are caramelized and desired temperature is reached. For reference, here are the temperature guidelines for cooking beef burgers.

-   165°F for well done
-   155°F for medium well
-   145°F for medium

### Can you grill these onion burgers?

Because of the onions, you’ll need a flat surface, like a cast iron pan, to put on the grill. If you want to skip the onions and just make a burger, you can put the patties directly on the grill.

Tuck this recipe into your recipe files and serve them up for a Meatless Monday, a slow summer evening with the fam, or next year’s National Hamburger Day!

## Onion Beyond Burgers

Yield: 4 burgers

### INGREDIENTS

-   1 lb beyond meat (four 4 oz patties)
-   2 medium-large yellow onions, thinly sliced
-   4 hamburger buns
-   Sea salt
-   Black pepper

### METHOD

-   Prepare burgers by thawing (if frozen) and portioning into 4 oz patties. Skip the portioning part if you’ve purchased the pre-portioned patties.
-   Sprinkle the top and bottom of each burger with a pinch of sea salt and fresh ground black pepper.
-   Remove the papery outer layers from the onion, cut the onion in half lengthwise, then slice into thin strips.
-   Heat a large cast iron skillet, frying pan, or griddle over medium-high heat.
-   Place each patty on the cooking surface and cover with onions. Using a spatula, press down on the onion burger to press the onions into the patty.
-   Cook the burger for a couple of minutes until the patties have browned. Flip and cook so that the burger patty is cooking on top of the onions, until the onions are caramelized, and the patty has reached the desired temperature: 165°F for well done; 155°F for medium well; 145°F for medium.
-   Remove the burgers from your cooking surface once they’ve reached your desired temperature.
-   Assemble the burger by smearing the bottom bun with mustard and/or other condiments of choice. Next, add sliced dill pickles to the bottom bun, followed by the onion burger. Top with lettuce, tomato, other toppings of choice, and the top bun. Serve and enjoy!

Notes:

-   Leftover burgers can be stored, covered, in the refrigerator for a few days.

Shelf Life: 3 days Prep Time: 5 minutes Cook Time: 20 minutes
