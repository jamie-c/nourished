As a Functional Nutrition Counselor (and health foodie), I’m often asked my favorite food brands and go-to grocery goods for making healthier dietary choices.

When it comes to grocery shopping, we’re huge fans of automation, convenience, quality, and, of course, reasonable pricing. It comes as no surprise that preparing healthy meals for yourself and your loved ones does require more time and energy than fast, convenient food options. But, the payoff for your health cannot be underestimated. This is why streamlining your shopping experience whenever and wherever possible can be such a lifesaver during busy days and seasons! 

One of the most important ingredients for being able to whip up a nourishing, home-cooked meal is, well, healthy ingredients! A well-stocked kitchen is key to making more healthy plates when your life-plate is FULL.

One of my favorite online shops for healthy, sustainable products is Thrive Market which is an online membership-based delivery service that saves time, money, and mental energy. The company provides access to high quality, organic/non-GMO products that are often more affordable than what I find in grocery stores. You can shop from a wide selection of categories from food and household products to bath and body care – and even babies and kids! 

You can even browse by diets, like gluten-free, low FODMAP or AIP which means you can shop with more clarity and ease, if you have diverse dietary needs.

Thrive Market helps you find health-supportive foods and products in (mostly!) one place from the comfort of your home. I say mostly because we do purchase things, like fresh produce, in local stores, and do monthly Costco runs.

In this way, our grocery shopping experience follows a pretty predictable schedule and is automated wherever possible. One way we do this with Thrive is by using the auto-ship feature, which allows us to schedule recurring shipments and lock in even more discounts. We have our staples set to deliver every four to eight weeks, depending on frequency of use. You can choose how often you want each product delivered – it’s incredibly simple to set up and streamline to your needs and life. You can always skip certain products, change the date of your shipment, or choose to ship your items sooner, if necessary.
