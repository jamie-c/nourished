There are so many tools available for use in the kitchen! What is really essential? Some tools are absolutely necessary, like a knife; others are totally unnecessary, like a dedicated avocado slicer. It’s not that I’m against single purpose tools altogether, however, in this post I’m sharing the basic tools that will allow you to do most everything - a beginner setup that’s good enough to last a lifetime. I’ve created a PDF download for you to reference.

To create this list, I took a look at the tools and equipment we reach for every day, both at home and at the restaurant.

This list starts with a good chef knife! There are so many resources available on the differences between knife styles, steel types, brands, etc. I will not be going over that info here. Rather, I recommend just buying one you like, and learn how to sharpen it. Please stay within your budget, knives can get extremely expensive, and the return on quality per dollar spent really drops off around the $100 mark. I have knives ranging from $4 to $400, and use them all equally, and enjoy them all equally! Just buy something you like, and can afford, and use it.

You can use a chef knife for just about everything. A sharp knife with appropriate use can take the place of a mandoline slicer, a spiralizer, a peeler, a food processor, a grater, a garlic press, a citrus press, scissors, and more. While that equipment is nice to have, and can save time, it’s not essential if you have a good, sharp knife.

In order to keep your knife in good condition, you’ll want a large end-grain wood cutting board.

End-grain wood is the best material for cutting boards. It is self-healing, meaning the knife

My personal favorite is maple, because just like in baseball, maple produces the best sound when hit. Any material designed for kitchen knives will work well. Pick a size you will be comfortable leaving out on your counter full time, ready at a moments notice.

How to keep a knife sharp? The easiest method for consistent sharpness is an electric sharpener. Whetstones are another method, and can be used to achieve superior results in about the same amount of time. I have both, and use both. I recommend getting what you will actually use and take the time to learn! The important thing is to sharpen your knives. There is not a knife in existence that can withstand daily use and never need to be sharpened. Some knives need sharpening every few hours, some once a month, others as needed. How often you have to sharpen depends on the type of steel, how the knife was made, how the knife is used, and how often it is used.
