Here at Nourished, we hold fast to our belief that there is no cookie-cutter approach to eating for health — or establishing long-term health, in general.

We believe that the body holds a lot of wisdom, and that our intuitions can be our best health-guides when we learn how to tune in and consistently take action on the habits that prove to support our bodies.

As a functional nutrition coach, I help people tap into the power of diet and lifestyle modification to help bring their visions of health to life.

And, I’m not just talking about weight loss or more energy. I mean the deep and gritty goals that will help people step into their fullest potential and live life with less stress around food and health. Goals like:

-   Confidence to express your style through fashion or a new hairstyle
-   Energy and brain power to explore that new creative passion burning within — like becoming a better writer or painting; learning hand-lettering or any new hobby of interest.
-   Rediscovering — or maybe discovering for the first time! — a spirit of play and curiosity that pulls you out into the world and new experiences.

When you peer at your health goals through a more soul-centered lens, you begin to realize that establishing or recovering your health is about so much more.

So, what are the 5 non-negotiable areas of focus for improved health? They are:

-   Sleep and relaxation
-   Exercise and movement
-   Nutrition and hydration
-   Stress and resilience
-   Relationships and networks

It amazes me how many health issues can be rooted back to one or more of these areas — and how quickly people dismiss them as too simple. But, these skills are foundational to long-term health. You can’t overlook them for any pill, powder, or formula.

So what does it look like to harness the power of each of these areas?

### _**Developing the necessary skills and habits in each of these areas is going to look a little different for everyone.**_

But I bet you know more than you might realize!

**Try this exercise:** Take out a pen and paper and write down one habit in one or each of these areas that you know supports you and your health. Then, get real with yourself: Are you truly practicing this non-negotiable for yourself on a daily basis?

**Remember this:** You hold the greatest power over your health and how you feel in your body. Are you willing to show up for yourself in these five areas?
