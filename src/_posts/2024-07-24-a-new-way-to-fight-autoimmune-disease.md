I know you’ve tried a lot of things to not be in pain daily, be less tired, and MORE present in your daily life...

- On-and-off elimination diets
- Guzzling water
- Avoiding alcohol
- Massage, acupuncture, chiropractic care…
- Surgeries, tests, and medical procedures…

But, you’re still experiencing discomfort in your body on a daily basis…

What if I told you that you COULD have less pain, more energy, and be MORE present in your life in a matter of **days**?

Did you know that up to 80% of your immune system lives in your digestive system?

## This means that the food you eat interacts with your immune system on a daily basis. 

Your immune system is the driver of inflammation - the source of that pain you feel every day.

This is really good news for you...

It means that you can **use food to make your symptoms better!**

One of the best ways to reduce inflammation is through food. Certain foods and habits increase inflammation and others decrease it. 

When you’re dealing with autoimmunity, chronic pain and fatigue, **reducing inflammation INSIDE YOUR BODY is a top priority**.

This means that learning to optimize your diet can be the solution you’ve been desperately searching for.

Here’s what can happen when you learn how to eat in a way that helps your body heal:

- You reduce the inflammation that is attacking your joints, tissues, and cells.
- You calm your immune system, which decreases the severity of your symptoms.
- When your symptoms decrease, your medication doses may decrease, too.
- Because medications have a lot of side effects and may lead to other problems, when you minimize medications as much as possible, this has a positive effect on your health and overall quality of life.
- In some cases, you can send your condition into remission.

Many people underestimate how much their diet affects them – and they're often amazed at how much better they feel after making EASY changes to their diet and habits. 

Like Lydia, who started noticing **less GI upset in the morning**, and **didn’t have a full-blown migraine** just from the goals we set in her FIRST session. 

If you KNOW you're not fueling your body with the right foods, let’s chat. We can do this TOGETHER.
