I promised a post on the secrets of health digestion and today I’m here to deliver three of them!

In my post [“An Introduction to The Digestive System”](/blog/an-introduction-to-the-digestive-system) I shared one of my favorite mindset reframes around food:

**You’re not what you eat, but what your body can do with what you eat.**

In other words, the state of your health is dependent on what (and how well) your body can break down and absorb the food you eat.

As a refresher, the process of breaking down and absorbing nutrients from food happens in the digestive tract.

Your digestive system is approximately 30 feet long — extending from the mouth to the anus. To imagine this, consider the height of a telephone pole – wow, right?! That’s what is coiled up inside of you, helping you make the most of the food you eat on a daily basis.

Here’s a quick look at the anatomy of your digestive system:

-   Oral cavity (Your mouth)
-   Salivary glands (the glands that produce saliva, which holds enzymes to help break down your food)
-   Esophagus
-   Stomach
-   Small intestine
-   Large intestine/Colon
-   Rectum/Anus

There are steps we can take to support each of these stops along the digestive tract, but today we’ll do a broad summary of the top tools for supporting healthy digestion to keep this information bite-sized and more…_digestible_.

## The top tools for healthy digestion include:

-   Fiber
-   Water
-   Stomach acid support
-   Probiotics in food and supplement form
-   Enzymes

### Fiber

Fiber is what remains from the plant foods we eat after it has moved through the small intestine. It supports healthy bowel movements and helps food move through the large intestine at a good pace. It also helps remove bad bacteria from the colon while simultaneously feeding the beneficial bacteria.

### Water

Water is important for countless reasons, but especially as you increase fiber in the diet. In addition to helping the fiber move more readily through the system, your stomach also requires ample amounts of water for good digestion.

This brings us to our next tool for healthy digestion: **Stomach acid support**.

Did you know that you actually want your stomach to be very acidic? (A pH level of 1-2 for those of you who like the specifics.)

Hydrochloric acid (HCl) which is produced in the stomach (aka stomach acid) helps break down and absorb the food you eat into the small nutrients your cells need to function. Stomach acid also helps kill any bacteria or pathogens that may have entered your body through the mouth – this protects you from those pathogens entering your bloodstream and causing issues.

Ample water is required for the production of hydrochloric acid (HCl) at the proper pH level.

When stomach acid production is too low, due to chronic stress or aging, for example, it can trigger additional digestive issues, as well as immune issues due to the potential for those pesky pathogens to sneak in.

So, supporting healthy stomach acid production…it's an important step for your health and it can be simple.

### Apple Cider Vinegar

Apple cider vinegar (ACV) is a gentle way to boost stomach acid production. The acids in the vinegar help gently boost the acidity in the stomach, helping to improve the breakdown of nutrients, the absorption of those nutrients, and better digestion overall.

Start low here to see how your body responds. Start with 1-2 teaspoons of organic, raw, unfiltered ACV in 8-12 ounces of water. You work your way up to 1 tablespoon as you see how it feels. Try this tonic first thing in the morning to jumpstart your day, digestively speaking, or drink it before your meals.

My favorite brand is [Bragg Organic Apple Cider Vinegar with the Mother](https://amzn.to/3ldtCh2). Costco also carries [North Coast Organic Raw ACV](https://amzn.to/3yDflNO) that I get on occasion.

**A quick note:** If you have inflammation of the esophagus, you’ll want to work on healing the inflamed tissue of your esophagus before trying this tip. You can also start with 1 tablespoon of lemon juice in warm water, as this is more gentle on the stomach.

## Key Takeaways

The health of your digestive system is critical for you to reap the benefits from the food you eat. A healthy digestive system ensures that your cells receive the nutrients they need for optimal functioning. There are simple techniques you can bring into your routine on a daily basis that will help shift your digestive status to be more efficient!

If you don’t keep lemons or raw apple cider vinegar in your kitchen, add them to your grocery list now!
