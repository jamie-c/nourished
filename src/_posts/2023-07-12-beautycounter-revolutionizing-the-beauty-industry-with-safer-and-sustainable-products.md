In functional nutrition, we believe that every one of our daily habits holds the power to positively drive our health outcomes. Daily habits like food, movement, environmental influences, stress levels, and even our thoughts are factors that literally turn our genes on or off.

The environmental influences are often overlooked or missing from the conversation all together. But, not on my watch.

From brain fog and autoimmunity to infertility and certain cancers, environmental toxins are linked to every chronic health issue we see today — and education around the topic is lacking or left out entirely of medical education in the U.S.

Over on my [Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/nourishedco/), I&apos;ve been sharing behind-the-scenes of my skincare and makeup routines. These are two examples — skincare and makeup — of common environmental exposures we encounter 2-3 times per day. I joined Beautycounter&apos;s mission over four years ago, integrating it into my functional nutrition work to provide more comprehensive support to my clients and help make their lives easier.

In today&apos;s post, I want to share more about Beautycounter and why I&apos;m committed to the movement they&apos;re leading.

### Beautycounter&apos;s Mission and Commitment

Beautycounter is an _epic_ organization with the mission of getting safer products into the hands of everyone. They make high-quality and high-performance skin care, makeup, and body products with a commitment to health and safety standards that go above and beyond what&apos;s legally required in the U.S. They are undoubtedly setting the cleanest standards in the beauty industry.

They&apos;re committed to creating products made without any harmful or questionable ingredients, adhering to what&apos;s known as The Never List™. This is a list of more than 2,800 questionable or harmful chemicals that are never used as ingredients in the products. (P.S. When I joined Beautycounter&apos;s mission in 2019, that list was made up of 1,500 chemicals – that&apos;s an addition of 1,300 chemicals over the last four years!)

### Personal Experience and Connection

I became interested in these products when I got pregnant and had little mental energy to devote to finding products that could solve some of the skin issues I was experiencing. I wanted a one-stop shop with products that were safe, not insanely expensive, but, most importantly, that solved my skin problems! To be honest with you, I was skeptical. I&apos;ve tried a lot over the past decade and expected to be disappointed. But within two days, I was online ordering more products for me and my husband Jamie.

The more I dug into the company, the more I felt a connection to their mission and also similarities to my work in nutrition and lifestyle. Our company is founded on high health and safety standards! When we owned and operated a food spot in downtown OKC, we had a list of foods that we never used in our ingredient lists. There was a lot of alignment.

### Making the World a Better Place

It takes a lot for me to get behind a company - and even more for me to agree to become an advocate for them. Beautycounter isn&apos;t just selling skincare and beauty products. They&apos;re working to make the world a better place. Here&apos;s how:

-   They&apos;re leading a movement to create a future where all beauty is clean (and safe) beauty – for everyone. Beautycounter advocates for stricter guidelines and regulations within the personal-care industry, fighting to change the laws that govern what can and cannot be used in products, so that everyone has access to safer beauty.
-   Beautycounter prioritizes sustainability and is committed to creating products that are good for people and the planet. From responsible sourcing and sustainable packaging, to setting climate goals that are rooted in science, they are committed to do better in every aspect of their work. (I&apos;m telling you: An epic organization.)
-   As I&apos;ve already mentioned, they set the highest standards for clean with The Never List™ and their commitment to screen and assess every ingredient used against strict safety standards.

The result? High-quality skincare and makeup products that truly deliver results, without compromising your health.

Movements need advocates, people on the ground working for a greater good. I&apos;m deeply committed to spreading the word about the need for safer skincare and personal-care products. Beautycounter aligns beautifully with my mission to help people make the best decisions for their health with ease and confidence. Speaking from experience, making things simple and straightforward is critical for a person struggling with their health.

If you want help switching to safer personal-care products, I&apos;d love to be your guide. You vote for safer standards in the beauty industry at large when you spend your money on safer products.
