This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

I am currently in the process of migrating our site from Squarespace to Next.js. This is a work in progress!

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone $REPOSITORY_URL
cd repository
npm install
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load a custom font.

## Introduction

This project is a recreation of the nourishedfood.co website. The current version that the domain points to is a squarespace site.

Run this site locally to compare the two.

This version will eventually be deployed and replace the current site.

## Technologies

-   Next.js
-   Tailwind CSS
-   TypeScript
